## Shiryoku (思慮, eyesight)

_Still in development...._

A vision model(Image caption) implementing Mixture of Experts architecture. It uses a Convnet (interchanges with Vision transformer) for the encoder and a standard RNN/LSTM decoder. It was built using Pytorch and trained on the Moondream dataset.
